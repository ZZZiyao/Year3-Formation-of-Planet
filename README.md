#Computational Physics Final Project
Q1_Dust_Settling: Simulates pure advection to determine the time required for the local dust-to-gas density ratio to exceed 1 at various radial distances (R).

Q2_Q3_Q4_Loop_Alpha: Loops over alpha values to show the evolution of the maximum dust-to-gas density ratio over time at a fixed distance. (Advection-Diffusion)

Q3_Size: Simulates dust settling with varying particle sizes to identify critical sizes required for planet formation. (Advection-Diffusion)

Q4_Loop_Nt_and_alpha: Simulates numerical diffusion by varying grid resolution (Nz) and alpha values. (Advection-Diffusion)

A six-page conference-style [report](https://github.com/ZZZiyao/Year3-Formation-of-Planet/blob/main/Project3_Report.pdf) was written.
